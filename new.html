          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          Your smile, like the gentle touch of rose petals, sparks a flame of longing inside me.<br> 
		  When your hand brushes against mine, it's as soft and tempting as a rose petal's caress. 
		  Holding you close feels like cradling the most exquisite rose, intoxicated by your allure. 
		  Every second with you is a seductive waltz in a garden of roses, 
		  where desire blooms with every glance we exchange.
		  Our journey together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, my
          love. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
